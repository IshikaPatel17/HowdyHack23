  <h2>WHAT IS HOWDY HEROES?</h2>
   <p>We are a small website developed by four freshman engineering students. Together, we are the loudest, the
        proudest, members of the Fighting Texas Aggie class of 2027! We created this website to help out our fellow Aggie students who need some academic support in their classes.
        Our site helps Aggie students get matched with Aggie tutors (a.k.a Heroes!) who fit their academic needs. School's hard. Trust us, we are just as sleep deprived and stressed as y'all. So, use our site as a resource to
        find that support y'all need in order to succeed academically! Or, create an account as a tutor and help a fellow
        Aggie out and make some money. </p> <br><br>
